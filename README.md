# Controlling-a-Dynamic-Marble-with-Reinforcement-Learning
In this project the neural network class given by Professor Charles Anderson was modified to implement reinforcement learning used to solve the dynamic marble problem. It was implemented using ipython.
neuralnetworkQ is the modified version of professor's neural network.
